               Kathleen was born on an Air Force Base in Morocco, but was raised in Kansas where her mother grew up. 
               She graduated from Kansas University with her Bachelor of Science Degree in Occupational Therapy, back 
               when they were still riding around in covered wagons. Well, not quite that long ago, but almost. After 
               leaving Kansas for the big city of Boston, she attended Boston University to complete her Masters in 
               Human Movement (a combination of advanced OT courses, biofeedback, and movement for performance). <br>

               She then spent over 25 years living in the Colorado, where she worked as an OT and studied alternative 
               therapies. She studied Therapeutic Touch (which is a research-based energy therapy), and became certified 
               as a massage therapist. She has continued to study and learn the latest therapeutic techniques to bring a 
               holistic approach to her treatments, (ie. listening programs, aromatherapy, cranio-sacral therapy, reflexology, 
               and lymphatic massage).<br>

               In her youth, she fell in love with the Rocky Mountains and spent her free time camping, hiking, cross-country 
               skiing, and climbing an occasional “14er”. Her connection to Nature broadened, and soon she found herself trekking 
               in Asia and northern Nepal. There, she fell in love again, with exploring and connecting to the diverse cultures. 
               This ultimately lead her to use all her professional experience to work internationally. She shared her knowledge 
               and “knowhow” in the Republic of Armenia (in 1990, post-earthquake), Peru, Ecuador, and Vancouver Island, Canada.<br>
 
               In 2019, she moved to Asheville, NC to explore these beautiful mountains, and continue this holistic journey. 
               She feels blessed to have lived a life filled with so many extraordinary experiences and wonderful people.<br>
     
               Nationally and state (North Carolina) certified ( LMBT #18496)
